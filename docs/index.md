#### AR
AR stands for Augmented Reality. Augmented Reality is the integration of digital information with a user’s physical environment in real time. Unlike Virtual Reality which is a completely artificial environment, Augmented Reality overlays new information on top of the existing environment.
Avatar	An avatar is an interactive character which may be customized by the user. In the Metaverse, the player’s character is referred to as an avatar.
Bitcoin	Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator. Bitcoin can be sent from user to user using the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Users who help operate the bitcoin network (miners) are rewarded for doing so with Bitcoin. Operating the bitcoin network is referred to as bitcoin mining.

#### Blockchain	
A blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that lives on a network. Simply put, the blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system - thus, Blockchains are said to be tamper-proof. 

This public ledger is used to record transactions that take place across the network. These transactions can include cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, or NFTs, like Digital Land.

The tamper-proof and distributed nature of this ledger prevents the need for banks, brokers, or other intermediaries. Prominent blockchains include Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana - each still fundamentally a public ledger, but with different rules of operation.

#### Builder	
A builder is the individual or entity responsible for construction in the Metaverse. Builders can craft anything from digital buildings to full-fledged games and Metaverse experiences. 

#### Centralization	
Centralization is a setup in which the powers (e.g. authority, decision-making) are concentrated to a small group. Centralized projects can have the advantage of rapid decision making and tight direction, but centralized projects also expose risks for censorship and hacking. Many projects in the web3 space are measured on their degree of centralization or decentralization.

#### Closed Metaverse	
A closed Metaverse is one which tends to leverage more centralized systems of operation. For instance, a closed Metaverse may not handle its Land or transactions on the Blockchain. Meta, Fortnite, and Roblox are all examples of Closed Metaverses.
Cryptocurrency	A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Cryptocurrencies can be mined (i.e. by operating the cryptocurrency network) or purchased from cryptocurrency exchanges. Unlike with bank accounts, a cryptocurrency wallet houses the actual crypto tokens - or in other words, with cryptocurrency, you own your own money. 

#### DAO	
A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, an entity with no central leadership. Decisions are made from the bottom-up, governed by a community around specific rules enforced on a Blockchain. DAOs are collectively owned and operated by their members and can serve any number of purposes - freelancer networks where funds are pooled to pay for software, venture capital firms where funds are pooled and allocated by member votes, or even charitable organizations where members approved donations. 

There are many prominent DAOs making decisions every day. Examples include the Ethereum Foundation which governs the rules of the Ethereum network, Decentraland which decides what to build in the Decentraland Metaverse, MakerDAO which governs the Dai currency. 

#### Decentralization
Decentralization is a system in which the functions and powers are distributed and dispersed. Decentralized systems can be more tamper-proof and equitable, however, they can be slower to move and make decisions.

#### DeFi	
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for a variety of cryptocurrency & blockchain-backed financial applications geared towards disrupting financial intermediaries. Examples of DeFi technologies include decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, and insurance platforms.

#### Digital Nations
Digital Nations are groups of people that have common values and/or culture and spend their time in the same online places together. They may not physically live in the same area, but they believe the same things, use the same language (memes) and spend time in the same apps together. 

#### Digital Twin
A digital twin is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. A digital twin in the Metaverse should operate or behave exactly how it would in the real world.  

#### District
A district is a logical collection, or community, of Metaverse parcels and/or estates. Each district governs itself (see DAO) and may have its own theme. Popular districts in Decentraland include Vegas City, Fashion Street, and Festival Land.

#### Estate	
An Estate is a collection of adjacent parcels organized as a logical unit with a single owner. 

#### Ethereum	
Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain which allows for the transfer of cryptocurrency assets as well as the execution of computer programs on its network. Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum network exists on thousands of computers (nodes) worldwide - rather than a centralized server. Unlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum network can run Turing-complete code on its nodes via Smart Contracts. 

To transact or run Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network, users must pay Node operators a small fee. This fee, called the gas fee, scales dynamically up or down depending on network demand. The gas fee, as well as the cryptocurrency reward for node operators is expressed in Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency - Ether. 

Smart Contracts allow users to create Decentralized Apps (dApps) using Ethereum - similar to how computer programmers might use a service like AWS or Azure to create an application.   

#### Experiences
Since properties in the Metaverse are digital constructs, these properties can host much more than just buildings. Metaverse builders are said to craft experiences - rich, immersive features, games, or events on their properties that transcend what physical architecture can achieve. 

#### GameFi
GameFi refers to the collection of decentralized applications (dApps) with economic incentives. These incentives include things like tokens being granted as rewards for performing in-game tasks, mining resources, growing crops, or being active in a community. These incentives have spawned the “Play-to-Earn” economy.

#### Gas
Gas is the fee necessary to perform a transaction or execute a smart contract on the blockchain.

#### Interoperable
Interoperability is the ability to access and interact with information across various blockchain systems. For a Blockchain, this could be ensuring the ability to send and read data across different chains. For a Metaverse, this could be asset and avatar persistence across worlds and the ability to transport seamlessly between them. Blockchains and Metaverses aren’t, for the most part, natively interoperable. They require bridging, wrapping, and other cross-chain technologies to enable interoperability.

#### IoT	
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects that are embedded with sensors and capabilities such that they can be controlled by software. 

#### Land	
Metaverses allow users and communities to purchase Virtual Real Estate - the 'stuff' that makes up the digital world.

As with the real world, not all plots of land are equal. Location, community, and game mechanics are among the dozens of factors that can contribute to Land value. This presents a vibrant and exciting land-trading marketplace (hosted here on WeMeta!) to explore!
Layer 2	Layer 2 is a term used for solutions created to help scale an application by processing transactions off of the main blockchain while maintaining the same security measures and decentralization as the main blockchain.

#### Metaverse	
The 'Metaverse' is a common space where everyone can participate in a shared virtual universe.

The Metaverse is the new internet, an unfolding past the flat World Wide Web we've come to know. Whether it’s building together or working together, playing games or attending concerts, the Metaverse is a platform to connect the world.

In theory, the Metaverse is the collection of all virtual spaces on the web. In practice, individual spaces (worlds) often call their individual space a Metaverse.

#### Mining
Blockchain mining is the process by which transactions on the ledger are validated. The users who take part in blockchain mining are typically rewarded with the cryptocurrency for that given blockchain. 

#### Minting
Minting is the process of validating information and creating a new block (entry) in the blockchain (ledger). Minting is how new cryptocurrency and NFTs are introduced to the network.

#### Mixed Reality
Mixed Reality (MR) brings together real world and digital elements. In mixed reality, you interact with and manipulate both physical and virtual items and environments. In Mixed Reality you can see and immerse yourself in the world around you while simultaneously interacting with a virtual environment.  

#### Neighborhood
A neighborhood in the Metaverse is defined largely by the primary NFT communities adjacent a given parcel.

#### NFT
An NFT is a Non Fungible Token. Simply put, it is a cryptographically verifiable way of uniquely defining a digital item and its ownership. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be traded or exchanged for other NFTs at equivalency. If you mint (create), receive, or purchase an NFT on a blockchain, there is a secure, tamper-proof ownership record of your possession of that NFT.

Much of the next generation of the web, including the Metaverse, rely on NFTs to establish ownership of digital assets. In the case of the Metaverse, each parcel of Land (digital real estate) is an NFT. NFT communities are often defined by possession of certain community Tokens, for instance, CryptoPunks, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and CrypToadz.

#### Open Metaverse
The Open Metaverse is one which tends to leverage more decentralized systems of operation. For instance, Open Metaverses may sell Land (NFTs) or handle its transactions on the Blockchain, or otherwise be controlled & jointly owned by the community. Decentraland, Sandbox, Somnium Space, and Cryptovoxels are all examples of Open Metaverses.

#### Oracle
One shortcoming of Smart Contracts is that they cannot inherently interact with data or systems outside their native blockchain environment. These external resources are considered “off-chain” while data already stored on the blockchain is considered “on-chain”. Oracles provide a way for Smart Contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to access off-chain data in a secure way. 

#### Parcel
A parcel is the base unit or plot of Metaverse Land. In the Open Metaverse, parcels are NFTs which can be bought and sold on marketplaces. Parcels can be grouped together into Estates or Districts. The owner of a parcel has digital property rights, and can build architecture or experiences on top of their property. 

#### Phygital
Phygital is a combination of physical and digital experiences. Some NFTs are associated with physical items or vice versa. Unisocks and FOMO $Panty are examples of Phygital items.

#### Rollups
Rollups are layer 2 scaling solutions that perform transactions off the main blockchain but still post the data back to the main blockchain. 

#### Scene
The content that is deployed to or built on Land is called a scene. A scene is typically an interactive program that renders content - it could be a game, an interactive experience, or an art gallery - whatever can be programmed and rendered by the in-game engine is fair game.

#### Smart Contract
Smart Contracts are computer programs stored on a blockchain that run when pre-determined conditions are met. On Ethereum, Smart Contracts are executed by paying gas (Ether) to the node (network) operators. Smart Contracts are used to create & regulate DAOs, create NFTs, and remove middle-men from traditional finance applications. 

#### Stablecoins
A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that pegs its value to a reserve asset. Stablecoins attempt to offer the best of both worlds - the instant processing, security, and privacy of payments - as well as the volatility-free stability of fiat currencies. 

#### Tokenomics
Tokenomics is the study of the economics of cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency tokens. In DeFi and GameFi, it is import to study, understand, and design effective tokenomics to ensure that users are incentivized to use the product. Tokenomics covers areas like the supply & demand of a token, the ownership & governance models, the burn rate, and the mechanisms by which the tokens are used, traded, and transacted.

#### Tokens
A token is another word for cryptocurrency or cryptoasset. There are many types of tokens:
- Utility/DeFi Tokens are designed to be used for a particular purpose, usually within the application/protocol for which they are developed (e.g. FileCoin, LINK)
- Governance Tokens are specialized DeFi tokens which give holders a vote in the protocol of an app (e.g. COMP, ENS)
- Non-Fungible Tokens represent ownership rights to a unique digital or real-world asset (e.g. BAYC, LAND)
- Security Tokens act as a stock or share of the company
- Currency Tokens act the same way as real currency and are used for payment of purchases (e.g. Bitcoin, Eth)

#### Trustless
Trustless in the context of blockchain means that you do not need to place your sole trust in any stranger, institution, 3rd party, or middle main in order for a network or payment to function. 

#### Virtual Reality 
Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. In VR, the user is placed inside the environment and is able to act on the digital space and digital objects contained therein. 

#### Wallet
A digital, or blockchain, wallet allows users to store and manage their Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies & NFTs. When transactions on the blockchain occur - they often occur between (e.g. to and from) digital wallets (addresses). As the blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions in and out of these wallets, wallet owners can be said to directly own their own currency - versus a bank which holds that currency in custody. 

This is a massive plus for ownership and censorship-resistance, however, this does add a heavy burden to users who need to guard their wallets very closely. If a user loses access to their wallet or forgets the password - there is no central authority which can assist in recovery.

Common digital wallets include Metamask, Coinbase, and Exodus. Users can also store their currencies on a physical blockchain wallet such as Ledger.

#### Web3
Where Web1 (walled garden) refers to a collection of links and homepages, and Web2 (read/write) refers to an internet which lets you open and edit files rather than just view them - Web3 (read/write/own) refers to an internet which allows users to participate in the governance and operation of protocols for themselves. 

Web3 incorporates concepts of decentralization and token-based economics (tokenomics) to create new economies and ownership mechanisms for users who participate-in and use the web. 

#### World
A World is an individual Metaverse. Where the Metaverse is the collection of all digital spaces - Decentraland, Somnium Space, Cryptovoxels, and Sandbox are all worlds within the Metaverse.  
Zero Knowledge	Zero Knowledge Protocol (ZKP) is a way of doing authentication where no passwords are exchanged. ZKP allows a user to prove that they know a secret to some other party without actually revealing that secret. ZKP tools are extremely important for preserving privacy while still leveraging the benefits of the Blockchain.
